Add powerful affiliate shopping pages to your weblog with ease and earn commission from Amazon and eBay.

== Description ==

[WP Shopping Pages](http://wpshoppingpages.com/ "WordPress affiliate plugin") allows you to create powerful yet simple affiliate pages with a few clicks. The plugin uses the Amazon Product API and eBay affiliate feeds, allowing you to include any number of products related to your niche into the pages it creates. Simply enter the keywords of your choice and WP Shopping Pages can create a rich shopping page for each of them.

Although the name says "shopping pages" the plugin can generate posts as well. With its template system and many different settings you have full control over how your affiliate pages will look: You decide the number of Amazon products and eBay auctions in a page, the keywords and the title of the page and you can add any text or content of your own to customize your affiliate pages.

Some of the plugins features:

*  Create shopping pages filled with affiliate ads related to any keyword and topic of your choice.
*  Earn commission from the Amazon and eBay affiliate programs for anyone that buys from your pages.
*  You can include all available Amazon products and eBay auctions into your pages.
*  Templating system allows you to customize your pages and choose exactly how you want them to look.
*  Works with any WordPress theme. The plugin only generates the content of the pages, your theme chooses the look!
*  Many settings and options to fine tune your results. 
*  Premium version available with support for products from Linkshare and Commission Junction vendors and other advanced settings.

This free version of WP Shopping Pages allows you to create pages featuring Amazon products and eBay auctions. The [premium version](http://wpshoppingpages.com/ "WordPress affiliate plugin") contains fast support as well as additional functionality: Include products from any Commission Junction and Linkshare vendors inside your shopping pages, activate link cloaking to hide your affiliate links and use several other advanced features like automatic page updating and shortcodes. If you are interested in even more API integrations, like Youtube and Flickr, check out our [bulk management service](http://cmscommander.com/ "Manage multiple WordPress weblogs") for WordPress called CMS Commander.
